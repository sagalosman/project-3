# Clique  | Overview

Just weeks into the course at General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive I was able to create a game using my knowledge with what I learnt during the course. This was my first project that contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project was completed on my own in one week.

# Brief

The project brief stated that we had to:
Render a game in the browser
Have logic for playing the game and for winning
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Git and GitHub

# Planning

# Approach

There was more than five game idea to choose from and went for Snake. I decided to change it and made the popular game my own. I change the apple to an image of the earth and for the snake and its body was changed to stars.

I planned out and wrote down the rules of the game to make sure I at least had A working game. I had to figure out how the star moves, how the player controls it, how the earth appears on the screen once the player presses the play button and how the star develops when the food(earth) is consumed, and how the game can end, such as by crashing into a wall.

I First I looked at how each of these variables could be coded, as well as how to code the overall game grid. Making the grid of the game was a success because this was my second time around building a game on a grid base. Before I started writing the actual code, I was happy I spent the time planning out everything to preparing the features and imagining what the code would look like.



# Lessons Learned
It took me a long time to figure out a working code for this part and to make sure the computer can identify whether the starHead touches the wall or touches the earth because both of these should have different outcomes.

# Future Features

My game overall works well. The player can use the arrow keyboard to control the movements. It can collect points each time the star-head touches the earth and resets the game once it crashes to a wall. It would be a plus if the star can speed up every time it touches the earth and resets the game once the starHead collides with the body.
