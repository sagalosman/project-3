# Clique  | Overview

I join a group of four for this project to create a full stack web app using JavaScript,  MongoDB, ExpressJS and ReactJS. This is the first time working in a group project at  the General Assembely.



# Clique

We all decided to create an events orientated social media site. We aimed for Clique to be of Instagram and Facebook Events. You can invite friends, like and comment on events, create public or private events and view people's profiles.


Technologies Used:

* JavaScript (ES6)
* Sass
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* ExpressJS
* ReactJS
* Git and GitHub

# Planning

Here is a screenshot of our project plan.

# Approach

We as a group decided to work on the backend togother by taking in turns to code while using liveshare. Once the backend was complete, we disscussed what tasks each of us will be doing.

# API
We create our own API for this project. Below is a screenshot of our API.






# Lessons Learned
It took me a long time to figure out a working code for this part and to make sure the computer can identify whether the starHead touches the wall or touches the earth because both of these should have different outcomes.

# Future Features

My game overall works well. The player can use the arrow keyboard to control the movements. It can collect points each time the star-head touches the earth and resets the game once it crashes to a wall. It would be a plus if the star can speed up every time it touches the earth and resets the game once the starHead collides with the body.
